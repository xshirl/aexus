This is my final project for the Web Development course at La Guardia Community College. 
I am building a website for an online bookstore that I created that sells programming, math, and science books.
The site features a one-page website with a cart added on to it that is fully functional. I designed the front-end
of the cart. 
This site uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

It can be viewed at xshirl.github.io/aexus.
